# My Manager README

## Welcome

I‚Äôm excited to work with you! We hired you because we saw in you a person with skills that will help us, but as importantly someone who will make us all better as a team.

My job is to help you and our team maximize the impact we have on the organization and our product.

I do that through the following activities:

- Constructing a diverse, high talent, low ego team
- Clarifying priorities, strategy, and context
- Providing appropriate tools and removing barriers to productivity

## The 30,000 π view

You can think of me as your API to the rest of the organization. Need a contact on some distantly-related team? Not sure who to talk to about changing your dental plan? I‚Äôll either know or will find out who the right person is and connect you to them.

## Growth mindset

More important to me than what you know now is that you are open to learning. I believe everyone is capable of improving, both as technicians and human beings. I ask that you open yourself to the possibility of getting better at what you do and who you are. Life is a journey. Let‚Äôs grow together!

## Ethics

I will do everything in my power not to ask you to do anything unethical or illegal. If you are concerned that something I or the organization have asked of you falls in either of these categories, please raise the issue with me immediately.

## Meetings

In general, I endeavor to keep meetings focused and relevant to the work at-hand. You‚Äôre a maker, so you benefit from blocks of uninterrupted time. Whenever possible, I will try to group meetings together so you can find those blocks.

### 1 to 1s

We will likely talk most days, but I believe there is value in having a regularly scheduled time when you know you have my full attention.

To that end, please schedule a recurring 1 to 1 meeting with me of at least 30 minutes weekly, but longer and/or more often if that‚Äôs what you want/need.

The agenda for this meeting is yours to set. We can talk project status in these meetings if you want or you might find this time is more useful to you when we talk about your long term goals and priorities.

## My schedule

You might make a face like Edvard Munch‚Äôs *[The Scream](https://www.pillarboxblue.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Scream-original-sm.jpg)* when you look at my calendar. Don‚Äôt let that dissuade you from ‚Äúbothering‚Äù me. I‚Äôm a manager. I am interruptible. Also, it‚Äôs OK to reschedule any meeting between the 2 of us to a time more convenient for you, unless I tell you otherwise.

## My values

These are mine. Help me understand yours!

- **Transparency:** I will err on the side of providing more, rather than less context.
- **Compassion:** We are not our job titles. I want the best for you as a person as well as an employee. I will do my best to approach you with kindness, respecting your agency as a human being.
- **Honesty:** I believe it‚Äôs important to be truthful, even (especially!) when it‚Äôs difficult. I believe this is compatible with compassion because it is better to give uncomfortable feedback early rather than let someone be blindsided later.
- **Trust:** I will trust you until you give me reason not to, rather than make you earn my trust.
- **Diversity & inclusion:** Working with a heterogenous team is harder than working with one where everyone is the same, but the results are better, in part *[because it‚Äôs hard.](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-diversity-makes-us-smarter/)* I will do everything I can to model inclusive behavior and build a diverse team that helps us all achieve our best.

## Feedback

I believe in giving feedback early and often. This may feel scary at first, but know that my intention is always to help you be more effective in your role.

I want your feedback! If you think I‚Äôve messed up, please tell me. If you think I did a great job, please tell my boss. üòâ

I will strive to make my feedback to you specific, dispassionate, and actionable (listen for ‚ÄúMy request of you is‚Ä¶‚Äù). I ask that you try to take the same approach with me, but if you can‚Äôt muster all 3 of those attributes, let‚Äôs still talk!

## Work/life ______

Work/life balance or [work/life integration](https://www.haas.berkeley.edu/human-resources/life-integration/), it‚Äôs your choice. I am more concerned about the impact you make than when you make it. That said, you are working on a team, so I ask that you keep your collaborators informed of your availability and that you try to maintain at least a couple of hours per day of overlap with your teammates‚Äô schedules for synchronous communication.

## Speaking of communication‚Ä¶

We‚Äôre all on slightly different schedules. If you receive Slack messages or emails from me outside your customary work hours, you should feel free to respond when next you‚Äôre working. There may be times when I need an immediate response. If that is the case, the onus is on me to make that clear.

## Social media

I can be found on social media [here](http://example.com/twitter), [here](http://example.com/facebook), and [here](http://example.com/linkedin) and my personal website is [here](http://example.com/homepage).

You are free to follow/friend me.

Please feel precisely, *exactly* **ZERO** pressure to follow/friend me on any platform outside of work (i.e. we need to be connected on Slack and GitHub, but it‚Äôs up to you whether we connect on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn).

I will not follow/friend you unless you explicitly tell me it‚Äôs OK with you.

## About me

**I‚Äôm only human.** I have pet peeves, quirks, and things I‚Äôm working to improve, as I‚Äôm sure you do. In the spirit of transparency, the following are some of the ones I‚Äôm aware of (everyone has blind spots!) that seem relevant to our working relationship (i.e. people not using their turn signals is probably not a relevant pet peeve in this context):

- I get annoyed when I‚Äôm repeatedly asked for information that has been communicated and documented. Information overload is real, but please make an effort to do at least a cursory search for things I‚Äôve already communicated and ask me for them only if you come up empty.
- I am an introvert. That doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not social! What it means (at least for me) is a couple of things:
	1. I process internally before speaking,
	2. In group discussions, I am often content to let others bring out the points I want to make on a topic and may only speak up if my points aren‚Äôt covered, and,
	3. I recharge via alone/quiet time.
- I highly value harmony. This isn‚Äôt itself a bad thing, but I am working on getting better at honoring my value of being honest even when it makes the conversation difficult.

**Also, I‚Äôm human!** I have interests outside of work. Those include hobby1, hobby2, and hobby3 (anonymized for purposes of this application, but I‚Äôd love to tell you about them!)

### Influences

These are mine. What are yours?

- Servant leadership ‚Äî¬†I don‚Äôt remember the specific book that introduced me to the concept, but I fully subscribe to the idea that I work for my team rather than the other way around.
- *The Heart Aroused,* by David Whyte ‚Äî I listened to this as a book-on-tape (yes, cassette tape!) for the first time in 1997 and have returned to it several times over the intervening 20+ years. One of its central tenets is that we are more fulfilled when we can bring our whole selves to our work. I strive to do that myself and do my best to set up an environment where others can as well.
- Twitter‚ÄîYes, Twitter. A few years ago, I intentionally set out to follow a diverse set of people who could speak to some of the systemic issues of inequity in our industry. Those people led me to follow other people, both in and out of tech, who are actively trying to improve things by dismantling structures that unfairly put some groups at a disadvantage. I took the approach of just listening. Over time, I graduated to believing. I thought I was pretty progressive before, but this practice has literally broadened my outlook and made me a much more ardent proponent of inclusion and diversity in tech and society.
